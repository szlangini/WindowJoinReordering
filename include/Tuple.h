/**
 * Represents a data tuple used in stream processing.
 *
 * Members:
 * - `values`: A vector of long integers holding the data values.
 *   - If `values` contains a single element, it represents a tuple from a
 * single data stream.
 *   - If `values` contains multiple elements, it represents a tuple resulting
 * from a join operation between multiple streams.
 * - `timestamp`: A long integer representing the time associated with the
 * tuple.
 *   - This could be the time of creation, reception, or processing of the
 * tuple.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This struct is utilized in scenarios where data tuples need to be managed,
 * whether they originate from individual streams or are intermediate results
 * from stream joins. The `timestamp` aids in temporal operations, ordering, or
 * windowing functions in stream processing.
